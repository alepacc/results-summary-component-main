## My process

A responsive results summary UI built with semantic HTML, Sass (compiled to CSS) and vanilla JavaScript. The summary items are populated dynamically from a local JSON file.

Features
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Dynamic data loading from `data.json`
- Accessible focus/hover states and semantic markup

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on improving my skills in dynamically loading content using JavaScript. I learned how to fetch data from a local JSON file and use that data to populate HTML elements on the page. This involved understanding how to work with the Fetch API and manipulating the DOM based on the retrieved data.
